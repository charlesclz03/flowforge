# FlowForge - Current Status Summary

**Date**: November 17, 2025  
**Version**: 0.2.0-alpha  
**Overall Completion**: ~80% (core MVP loop shipped; premium/social pending)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**What we thought (Nov 6)**: "The app is ready for production deployment"  
**What's actually true now (Nov 17)**: **The core MVP loop is fully implemented, wired to Supabase, and deployed to Vercel; the product is in private alpha while we add premium and social features.**

### Reality Check:

- ✅ **Backend infrastructure**: 100% complete
- ✅ **MVP user journey (core loop)**: 100% complete  
  _Sign in with Google → select beat & difficulty/frequency → practice with on‑beat prompts → record → review in recordings library._
- ⚠️ **Premium & social roadmap**: 0% complete (Stripe, Pro gating, public sharing still planned)
- ✅ **Deployment**: Vercel production at `https://flowforge-pi.vercel.app`
- ✅ **Overall project**: ~80% complete

---

## 💡 Key Insights

### What We Learned:

1. **Infrastructure ≠ Product**
   - Having a backend doesn't mean having an app
   - APIs are necessary but not sufficient
   - Marketing pages don't replace functionality

2. **Documentation ≠ Implementation**
   - Having guides doesn't mean features are built
   - Plans need to be executed
   - Requirements need to be implemented

3. **Deployment ≠ Launch**
   - You can deploy infrastructure
   - But you can't launch without a product
   - Users need the actual application

### What This Means:

- ✅ Foundation is solid
- ✅ Requirements are clear
- ✅ Path forward is documented
- ❌ Product is not ready
- ❌ Users can't use it yet
- ❌ MVP needs to be built
