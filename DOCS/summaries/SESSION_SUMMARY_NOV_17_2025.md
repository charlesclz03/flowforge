# Development Session Summary - November 17, 2025 (Design & UX Alignment)

**Session Duration**: Multi-hour working block  
**Focus Areas**: Figma alignment, onboarding/practice layout unification, header & auth polish, pricing and copy corrections  
**Overall Progress**: MVP still ~80% complete (Phases 1–4 done; UX now closely matches the FlowForge Figma design)

---

## 🎯 High-Level Goals

1. Make the **landing, onboarding, and practice** screens share a coherent, Figma-accurate visual system.  
2. Simplify the **onboarding flow** and CTA copy so the path to practice is obvious and consistent.  
3. Clean up the **practice experience** (word prompts, recording indicator, mic errors) so it feels stable and focused.  
4. Ensure **business details** (pricing, beats count) match the latest business plan.

## 🖼️ Layout & Shared Shell

### OnboardingLayout (new shared shell)

- Created `components/organisms/layout/OnboardingLayout.tsx` to standardize the core app shell:
  - Full-screen **black → purple gradient** background with ambient glow orbs.
  - Sticky `AppHeader` at the top (music-note + FlowForge wordmark, avatar/Google icon on the right).
  - Centered content area: `main#main-content` with `flex flex-1 items-center justify-center p-6`.
  - Bottom **page progress indicator** (`OnboardingProgress`) with three dots, highlighting:
    - Step 1: `/howitworks`
    - Step 2: `/difficultyselection` (and `/selectdifficulty`)
    - Step 3: `/practice`.

- Applied `OnboardingLayout` to:
  - Home (`LandingTemplate` → now wraps its sections in `OnboardingLayout`).
  - `/howitworks`
  - `/difficultyselection` (and alias `/selectdifficulty`)
  - `/practice`

Result: all core screens now share the same “purple HUD” frame, header, and progress indicator.

## 🧭 Onboarding Flow & Pages

### 1) How It Works (`/howitworks`)

- Replaced the old `PracticeTemplate` layout with Figma-style content:
  - `HowItWorksContent` now lives inside `OnboardingLayout showBackButton onBack={() => router.push('/')}`.
  - Three numbered cards (“Choose your beat”, “Configure session”, “Record & flow”) with modern glass cards and icons.
  - Feature grid for “Precision timing”, “Smart word bank”, “Beat synchronization”, and “Auto-recording”.
  - CTA button text simplified to **“Start”** (navigates to `/difficultyselection`).
  - Stats updated to match reality:
    - **10+** curated beats (was 50+).
    - 1,000+ words.
    - 2-minute sessions.
- Cleaned header copy and removed the “Ready to practice” pill for a more minimal hero.

### 2) Setup Session (`/difficultyselection` & `/selectdifficulty`)

- Replaced the older PracticeTemplate-based page with Figma-style **BeatSelectorPage** behavior:
  - Page is rendered inside `OnboardingLayout showBackButton onBack={() => router.push('/howitworks')}`.
  - Top section “Setup your session” with explanatory subtitle.
  - **Difficulty slider** + **Word Frequency slider** sit at the top in a single glassy config card:
    - `DifficultySelector`:
      - Value-specific pill colors: Easy → green, Medium → purple, Hard → red (like the Figma sliders).
      - Descriptions updated to match syllable-based difficulty.
    - `FrequencySelector`:
      - Labels “Every 4 bars / 8 bars / 16 bars” and copy aligned with the Figma copy.
  - Beat grid:
    - 2-column responsive layout of beats from `/api/beats?free=true`.
    - Selected beat highlights with purple border and slight scale.
    - Premium beats show a small yellow/orange badge (“Premium”) as per Figma.
    - Beat cards show title, artist, BPM, and genre chips.
  - Primary button:
    - CTA copy changed to **“Practice”** (enabled only when a beat is selected).
    - Disabled state: “Select a beat to continue”.
    - Uses the same purple gradient style as the hero CTA.
  - Added route alias `app/selectdifficulty/page.tsx` that re-exports this page.

Overall, `/difficultyselection` now feels like the middle step of a 3-page wizard that visually mirrors the Figma Beat Selector.

## 🎧 Practice Screen (`/practice`)

### Layout & Shell

- Wrapped the practice page in `OnboardingLayout showBackButton onBack={() => router.push('/difficultyselection')}`, replacing the older `PracticeTemplate` shell.
- Simplified `PracticeTemplate` to only layout content (no header, no full-screen wrapper) so it plugs cleanly into `OnboardingLayout`.

### Session Info & Timer

- `PracticeControls` redesign:
  - Top pill is now more glassy and lighter:
    - `border-white/15` + `bg-white/5/60` + `backdrop-blur-heavy` for a translucent glass effect.
    - Contents: `Beat Title • Artist • BPM` with purple separators.
  - The large timer (2:00 → 0:00) remains centered under the pill.

### Word Prompt Behavior

- `WordPrompt`:
  - When no word is active, it now displays a large, gradient **“READY TO START”** word instead of “Waiting for first prompt…”.
  - This component is always rendered from `PracticeControls`, with:
    - `word={currentWord || null}`
    - `show={isPlaying && !!currentWord}`
  - This keeps the vertical space reserved and prevents the **play button from jumping** when the first prompt appears.

### Recording Indicator & Mic Errors

- `RecordingIndicator` enhancements:
  - Added `showDuration?: boolean` prop; on the practice screen we pass `showDuration={false}` to avoid duplicating the timer text.
  - The indicator (red dot + mic icon) is now rendered **inline beneath the main timer**, inside the status row.
  - In `PracticeControls`, the mic indicator is driven by **play state and recording state**:
    - `isRecording={(isRecording || isPlaying) && !micPermissionError}`
    - So it turns **red as soon as you hit Play**, unless microphone permission is blocked.

- Mic permission UX:
  - We no longer show the big red error card when microphone access is denied.
  - Instead, we detect permission-related errors with:
    ```ts
    const micPermissionError =
      error?.toLowerCase().includes('notallowederror') ||
      error?.toLowerCase().includes('permission denied') ||
      error?.toLowerCase().includes('failed to access microphone')
    ```
  - `shouldShowError` now ignores these mic permission errors, and the indicator simply **stays gray**, signaling that recording isn’t active.

### Other Practice UX Tweaks

- Removed the inline “Press play to start your session” helper text above the timer to reduce clutter; the “READY TO START” prompt and play button affordance are enough.
- Removed the textual status labels (“Recording in Progress” / “READY TO START”) below the timer; only the indicator communicates state now.

## 🧱 Header, Auth & Avatar

### AppHeader refinements

- `AppHeader`:
  - Centered FlowForge title now includes a **music note icon** (`lucide-react` `Music`) in purple, matching the Figma header icon.
  - Back button support:
    - Props: `showBackButton` and `onBack`.
    - Renders a small text back button on the left when enabled (used on onboarding and practice pages).

- Account section (top-right):
  - For authenticated users:
    - Changed to a compact capsule showing **only the profile avatar**:
      ```tsx
      <Link href="/profile" className="inline-flex items-center rounded-full bg-background-card/70 p-1.5 hover:bg-background-card transition-colors">
        <UserAvatar mode="avatarOnly" />
      </Link>
      ```
  - For unauthenticated users:
    - `SignInButton` now supports a `mode` prop:
      - `mode="full"` → full Google button with text (used in hero).
      - `mode="icon"` → small circular Google “G” icon only (used in header).

Result: the header is visually lighter and closer to the Figma navigation bar, with the note icon centered and a simple avatar/Google icon on the right.

## 🏠 Landing Page (`/`)

### Shared Layout & Hero

- `LandingTemplate` now uses `OnboardingLayout` instead of its own bespoke background, so home shares the same purple gradient + orbs + header as the rest of the app.
- Hero CTA:
  - The primary CTA text changed from **“Play Now!”** to **“Practice Here”**.
  - Both authenticated Link and unauthenticated `SignInButton` use the same gradient style (`btn-primary bg-gradient-pulse`), routing to `/howitworks`.
  - The “FlowForge Sessions” pill above the headline has been removed for a simpler hero.
- Hero stats:
  - Updated `Beats Curated` from **15+ → 10+** to reflect the current seed data.

### Landing How It Works (quick explanation)

- `LandingHowItWorks` now mirrors the onboarding steps with shorter marketing copy:
  - **1. Choose your beat** – curated library with BPM/genre tags.
  - **2. Configure your session** – difficulty + frequency sliders (4/8/16 bars).
  - **3. Press play & flow** – 2‑minute run, on‑beat words, recording for review.

### Pricing Card (Business Alignment)

- `LandingPricing` Premium card:
  - Updated price from **$9.99/month → $4.99/month**, matching the README and business plan (Pro at $4.99/mo, $49.99/yr).
  - Recolored the card to use **purple gradient** instead of orange:
    - Border: `border-stroke-glow/60`
    - Background: `bg-gradient-to-br from-accent-purple/10 via-accent-purple/5 to-accent-violet/10`
    - “Coming Soon” pill + check icons use `accent-purple`.
  - Button updated to reuse the hero CTA style:
    ```tsx
    <button
      disabled
      className="btn-primary mt-8 w-full rounded-full bg-gradient-pulse px-8 py-3 text-center text-sm font-semibold text-black shadow-neon transition hover:shadow-glow disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50"
    >
      Coming Soon
    </button>
    ```

## 🔁 Smaller System-Level Tweaks

- **Loading screen**:
  - `app/loading.tsx` now returns `null` (no full-screen “Loading…” overlay), so routes “just start” without a blocking loading page.

- **Routing & copy**:
  - `/howitworks` back button—goes to `/`.
  - `/difficultyselection` back button—goes to `/howitworks`.
  - `/practice` back button—goes to `/difficultyselection`.
  - CTA labels harmonized across pages:
    - Home: “Practice Here”.
    - How it Works: “Start”.
    - Setup Session: “Practice”.

### Backend & Data Access Robustness

- **Prisma connection handling**:
  - Updated `lib/prisma.ts` so that in development it prefers `DIRECT_URL` (or falls back to `DATABASE_URL`) via Prisma’s `datasources` option.
  - This avoids exhausting pooled connections (e.g., `connection_limit=1` on Supabase-style URLs) and eliminates the `P2024` “Timed out fetching a new connection” errors seen during `/api/words/random` calls.
- **Word fetching fallback**:
  - `lib/db/words.ts / getRandomWords` now distinguishes between pool timeouts and other errors:
    - Pool timeouts log a concise warning and immediately fall back to an in-memory word list.
    - Other errors are still logged as errors, but the same safe fallback is used.
  - Net effect: the practice flow remains responsive even if the DB is temporarily unavailable.

## 📊 MVP Status After This Session

- **Core functionality** (auth, beat playback, prompts, recording, Supabase storage, recordings library) remains complete and stable.
- **UX improvements from this session**:
  - Onboarding and practice now look and feel like the Figma design (shared shell, glassmorphism, consistent colors).
  - CTA path from landing to practice is clear and copy-consistent.
  - Practice screen UX is cleaner: no jumpy layout, no noisy mic errors, clearer recording feedback.
  - Business-facing details (pricing, beats count) are aligned with the latest plan.
- **Overall project progress**: still ~**80%** (Phases 1–4 complete; premium and social features still planned but not implemented).

## ▶️ How to Resume Work Next Session

```bash
cd "/Users/c0369/Documents/AI BUSINESS/FlowForge - Freestyle"
npm install           # only if dependencies changed
npm run dev           # dev server at http://localhost:3000
```

Recommended next focus for the **next session**:

1. Deploy the current MVP state to the **Vesper/Vercel deployment environment**, including:
   - Verifying `DATABASE_URL` / `DIRECT_URL` and other secrets.
   - Wiring production Supabase/DB, storage, and auth callbacks.
   - Smoke-testing the full landing → onboarding → practice flow in production.

---

**Bottom line**: The MVP is now wrapped in a cohesive, Figma-accurate shell. The journey from landing → onboarding → practice feels intentional, the practice screen is calmer and clearer, and what users see now matches both the **design vision** and the **business plan**.
