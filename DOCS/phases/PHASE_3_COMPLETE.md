  - Web Audio API wrapper for beat playback
  - Supports play, pause, stop, seek, and volume control
  - URL encoding for audio files with spaces/special characters
  - Loop support for continuous beat playback
  - Event callbacks for time updates and track ending

- **useBeatPlayer Hook** (`hooks/useBeatPlayer.ts`)
  - React hook for integrating AudioPlayer into components
  - State management for: isPlaying, currentTime, duration, loading, errors
  - Beat loading and playback controls
  - Automatic cleanup on unmount

### 2. Microphone Recording System ✅

- **AudioRecorder Class** (`lib/recording/recorder.ts`)
  - MediaRecorder API wrapper for microphone recording
  - Automatic microphone permission handling
  - WAV format recording (44.1kHz, stereo)
  - Pause/resume functionality
  - Blob export for saving recordings

- **useRecording Hook** (`hooks/useRecording.ts`)
  - React hook for integrating AudioRecorder
  - State management for: isRecording, isPaused, duration, audio blob
  - Permission error handling
  - Recording lifecycle management

### 3. Word Prompt System ✅

- **Dynamic Word Generation**
  - Words fetched from database based on difficulty level (Easy/Medium/Hard)
  - Syllable-based difficulty:
    - Easy: 1-2 syllables (flow, beat, rhyme, power)
    - Medium: 2-3 syllables (elevate, authentic, energy)
    - Hard: 4-5+ syllables (metamorphosis, revolutionary, philosophical)
  - Word count calculated based on session duration and frequency

- **Synchronized Word Rotation**
  - Words change at precise intervals based on BPM and frequency setting
  - Independent session timer (not affected by beat looping)
  - Calculation: `secondsPerPrompt = (60 / BPM * 4) * frequency`
  - Examples:
    - 88 BPM, 4 bars: ~10.9s per word (11 words in 2 min)
    - 88 BPM, 8 bars: ~21.8s per word (5-6 words in 2 min)
    - 88 BPM, 16 bars: ~43.6s per word (2-3 words in 2 min)

- **WordPrompt Component** (`components/session/WordPrompt.tsx`)
  - Large, gradient text display
  - Smooth fade-in/scale animations
  - Persistent display (no auto-hide)
  - Only shows when session is playing

### 4. Practice Page Integration ✅

- **Complete Session Flow** (`app/practice/page.tsx`)
  - Beat selection from database
  - Frequency selector (4, 8, 16 bars)
  - Difficulty selector (Easy, Medium, Hard)
  - Session duration: 2 minutes (120 seconds)
  - Automatic recording start/stop with playback
  - Synchronized timer and word prompts

- **State Management**
  - Integrated `useBeatPlayer` and `useRecording` hooks
  - Independent session timer using `Date.now()`
  - Force re-render mechanism for smooth UI updates
  - Word list pre-fetching before session starts
  - Proper cleanup on stop/pause

### 5. UI Components ✅

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Audio Synchronization

The system uses **independent session timing** to avoid issues with looping beats:

```typescript
// Session timer (independent of audio looping)
const startTime = Date.now()
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  const elapsedSeconds = (Date.now() - startTime) / 1000
  const wordIndex = Math.floor(elapsedSeconds / secondsPerPrompt)
  setCurrentWord(wordList[wordIndex % wordList.length])
}, 100)
```

### Beat Looping

Beats automatically loop using HTML5 Audio API:

```typescript
audio.loop = true
```

### Recording Lifecycle

1. User selects beat and settings
2. Presses play → beat starts + recording starts
3. Words rotate based on elapsed time
4. Timer counts down from 2:00 to 0:00
5. Session auto-stops at 2:00 or user presses stop
6. Recording blob available for download/playback

### URL Encoding

Audio file paths are encoded to handle spaces and special characters:

```typescript
const encodedUrl = url
  .split('/')
  .map((part) => encodeURIComponent(part))
  .join('/')
```

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Progress Ring Gaps

- **Issue:** Circle had gaps at top/bottom
- **Fix:** Changed `strokeLinecap="round"` to `strokeLinecap="butt"` on both circles
- **Result:** Complete 360° ring

### 2. Timer Ring Visibility

- **Issue:** Background ring too dark (#2C2C2E) against black background
- **Fix:** Changed to lighter gray (#3A3A3C)
- **Result:** Clearly visible background ring

### 3. Word Rotation Not Working

- **Issue:** Words only changed 2 times in 2 minutes (should be 11+ at 4 bars)
- **Root Cause:** Using `audio.currentTime` which resets when beat loops
- **Fix:** Implemented independent session timer using `Date.now()`
- **Result:** Words change at correct intervals regardless of beat looping

### 4. Words Showing Before Play

- **Issue:** Word appeared immediately after selecting beat
- **Fix:** Only set `currentWord` when `handlePlayPause` is called
- **Result:** Words only appear when session starts

### 5. Recording Indicators Always Red

- **Issue:** Recording dot and mic icon always red, even when inactive
- **Fix:** Added conditional styling based on `isRecording` state
- **Result:** Gray when inactive, red when recording

### 6. Play Button Too Large

- **Issue:** Button took up too much space inside ring
- **Fix:** Reduced from 65% to 55% of ring size
- **Result:** Better visual balance

### 7. Auto-scroll to Empty State

- **Issue:** Page scrolled down to "Select a beat" message
- **Fix:** Removed empty state component
- **Result:** Page stays at beat selector

### 8. Beat Loading Failures

- **Issue:** Some beats failed to load (spaces in filenames)
- **Fix:** Added URL encoding to audio file paths
- **Result:** All beats load successfully

### 9. Practice Page Not Accessible

- **Issue:** `/practice` route protected by auth middleware
- **Fix:** Removed `/practice` from middleware matcher
- **Result:** Practice page accessible without login

### 10. Timer Display Broken

- **Issue:** Timer showing NaN or large numbers
- **Fix:** Added fallback `|| 0` to `beatPlayer.currentTime`
- **Result:** Timer displays correctly (2:00 → 0:00)

## 📝 Notes

### Difficulty System

The word difficulty is based on syllable count:

- **Easy (1):** 1-2 syllables - Simple, common words
- **Medium (2):** 2-3 syllables - Moderate complexity
- **Hard (3):** 4-5+ syllables - Complex, multisyllabic words

This system challenges rappers to:

- Fit longer words into bars while maintaining flow
- Develop breath control for complex words
- Expand vocabulary and rhyme-finding skills

### Frequency System

Frequency determines how often words change:

- **4 bars:** Quick rotation, more challenging
- **8 bars:** Balanced, standard practice
- **16 bars:** Slower rotation, allows deeper exploration

### BPM Considerations

Different BPMs affect word rotation timing:

- **Slower BPM (70-90):** More time per bar, easier to fit complex words
- **Medium BPM (90-110):** Balanced challenge
- **Faster BPM (110-130):** Less time per bar, requires quick thinking
