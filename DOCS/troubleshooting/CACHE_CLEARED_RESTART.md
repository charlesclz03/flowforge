## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Clear Browser Cache

**Important**: You should also clear your browser cache:

#### Chrome/Edge:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Select "Cookies and other site data" (optional, but recommended)
4. Click "Clear data"

2. Or go to Safari > Preferences > Advanced > Show Develop menu
3. Then Develop > Empty Caches

### 2. Test the Recordings Page

1. **Open browser:**
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Sign in (if not already):**
   - Click "Sign In" button
   - Complete Google OAuth flow

3. **Test `/recordings` page:**
   - Try to access: `http://localhost:3000/recordings`
   - **Expected**: Should show recordings page (if signed in)
   - **Or**: Should redirect to home page (if not signed in)

4. **Test redirect flow:**
   - Sign out
   - Try to access: `http://localhost:3000/recordings`
   - **Expected**: Redirected to home page
   - Click "Sign In"
   - **Expected**: After signing in, redirected to `/recordings`

### 3. Verify Everything Works

- ✅ Server is running on `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ Can access home page
- ✅ Can sign in
- ✅ Can access `/recordings` when signed in
- ✅ Cannot access `/recordings` when signed out (redirects to home)
- ✅ After signing in from redirect, goes to `/recordings`

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

### Check Server Logs
Look at the terminal where `npm run dev` is running for any errors.

### Check Browser Console
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for any JavaScript errors
3. Check Network tab for failed requests

### Verify Environment Variables
```bash
# Check if environment variables are set
grep -E "NEXTAUTH|DATABASE|SUPABASE" .env.local
```

### Restart Again
If needed, you can restart again:
```bash
# Kill server
pkill -f "next dev"

# Clear cache
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules/.cache

# Restart
npm run dev
```
